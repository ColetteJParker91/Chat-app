# Chat-app

This is a native mobile app built using React Native that allows users to enter a chat room, send messages, images, and their location.

I built this application to practice my native app development skills using React Native. Features include:
+ sending messages 
+ storing data locally for offline access
+ permission requests for access to location and the camera
+ access to camera roll, camera and location services on the device




Install
- npm install --g expo-cli

- clone repository with package.json file and run npm install

- run on phone or android studio emulator

- type expo start in project folder and follow the instructions

Note: The app is connected to my own Firebase database which I run, but feel free to make your own database and connect it to your local version of the app to create private chat.
